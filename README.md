## Problem statement

This project collects information on car/motorcycle/bicycle thefts and residential burglary hotspots in Taipei City, Taiwan. We gather this data through an API and store it in Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery. We use Mage to execute ETL tasks. Initially, the raw data is written to Google Cloud Storage as a Data Lake. Then, we partition the data in Google Cloud Storage and write it to Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery.
